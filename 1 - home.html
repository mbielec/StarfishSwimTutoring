                <p>Starfish Swim Tutoring is a Mississauga-based private swimming lesson service running May through August, for those who already have access to a
                backyard, condo, or apartment pool. Why pay for expensive lessons and leave the comfort of your home, when an
                    instructor can come to you?<br><br>

                Your lessons can be adjusted to
                match the requirements of any swim program, whether it be Swim to Survive, YMCA, or Red Cross. This allows you
                    to seamlessly switch back once fall comes around. Starfish Swim Swim Tutoring is insured by the Lifesaving Society.<br><br>
                ​Taking lessons is incredibly convenient. Summer is a busy time, and whether you fall sick, go on vacation,
                or send your kids to summer camp, you can easily reschedule your lesson for any time and day. </p>

                <p><b>Who will be my instructor?</b><br><br>

                    My name is Maya Bielecki, and I've been running Starfish Swim Tutoring since June of 2016. I am currently
                    the sole instructor. I'm in my third year of university, and have been instructing and lifeguarding for three years.<br><br>

                    I have valid NLS and Instructor's Certifications, as well as Emergency Medical Responder First Aid. I've worked at
                    the YMCA, then a private program called Swim101, and I've been working with children for seven years.
                    During the school year, I volunteer on my university medical response team, and teach first aid courses.<br><br>

                    <b>What makes Starfish Swim Tutoring better than local group lessons?</b><br><br>

                    I've taught hundreds of classes, and I've seen time and time again how much faster kids learn one-on-one.
                    In large classes, it's difficult to accommodate all the different strengths and weaknesses and give each
                    child enough attention. Kids who misbehave can throw the lesson off track for everyone, and children have
                    to take turns, which decreases learning time.<br><br>

                    Your child will progress more in one private lesson than they would in three group lessons, yet the costs
                    involved are similar. Private lessons simply offer better value for your money.</p>

                <p>​This effect diminishes slightly with older swimmers, but at-home instruction is still much more convenient
                and cost-efficient. If you travel to your lesson, not only are you wasting your time and money on
                transportation, but the fees you're paying are going towards the maintenance of a pool you don't even need!</p>
