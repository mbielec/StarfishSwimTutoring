            Maya,<br>

            Here's my review.  Keep up the great work!  Let me know if you want to make any changes. <br><br>


            We are very happy that we found Starfish Swim Tutoring.  This is our second summer using her services.  Maya
            is a great swim instructor to our twin 7 year old daughters.  She offers a professional service, she has great
            communication and her rates are reasonable. <br><br>

            Maya provides challenging lessons that push our kids to their fullest potential.  What we like most is Maya's
            commitment to proper swimming techniques.  She does not hesitate to stop our kids mid-stroke to make corrections
            to their swimming form or posture.  She offer a lot of praise when they do well which is encouraging. <br><br>

            We are happy with the results and plan to continue using Maya as their private swimming instructor in the future.
            Maya provides a 5 star service and I would highly recommend her to anyone who is interested. <br><br>
            Regards, <br>
            Terry</p>
