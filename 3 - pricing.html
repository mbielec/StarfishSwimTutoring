        <h2>Pricing</h2>
        <p>Your first lesson with Starfish Swim Tutoring is <b>FREE</b>. I want to make sure that the service is right
        for you before you commit. After that, the cost is calculated based on lesson time.</p>
        <div id = "prices"><h3>$45/HOUR<br>$34/45 MINS<br>$23/HALF HOUR</h3></div>
        <p>When you purchase a class, you purchase the time. You can put from 1 to 3 people in each class, provided
            they are around the same level. For example, you can choose to have your kids take lessons together, or
            invite your friends to join the class in order to lower your cost.</p>
        <p>I recommend that younger swimmers take private lessons, since they will have to take turns
            being in the water. What was a 30 minute lesson for 3 kids only amounts to 10 minutes swimming time for
            each one.</p>
        <p></p>

        the added benefit of the instructor coming right to your door. Also, you are guaranteed an experienced instructor
