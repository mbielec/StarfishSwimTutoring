            <h2>Program</h2>
            <p> I work with students of all ages, from year-old babies to non-swimmer adults. Everyone is welcome!
                Children are never too young to start learning to swim, and I will gladly do a parent and tot lesson.
                However, paid lessons might not be right for you if your child can't yet follow directions, or does
                not have the motor skills to control their limbs. Until then, you can give them a head start by
                taking them to a local pool and getting them used to the water.<br><br>

                I do not follow any official program, but instead tailor each lesson to the student's needs. "Levels" are useful
                when trying to pair students together for classes, but in practise, I find that students perform to various
                standards in different skills. For example, a student may be very strong at front crawl, but weak at treading
                water. It does not make sense to stall progress in that student's strokes until their treading is at a passable
                level. I do not use a pass/fail approach. Instead, I teach each skill at a level that is challenging to the
                participant. Here are some of the skills that are taught, in <b>approximate</b> order:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Submerging face, breathing techniques</li>
                <li>Floating, front and back, and getting back onto feet from both positions</li>
                <li>Kicking on front and back</li>
                <li>Rolling over during kicking (front to back, back to front)</li>
                <li>Basic treading water</li>
                <li>Jumping into water, getting into horizontal position, returning to wall</li>
                <li>Kicking on side</li>
                <li>Alternating front glide, side glide</li>
                <li>Picking up objects from pool bottom</li>
                <li>Front crawl</li>
                <li>Back crawl</li>
                <li>Various entries into water, dives</li>
                <li>Whip kick on front, back</li>
                <li>Treading water with whip kick</li>
                <li>Elementary backstroke</li>
                <li>Breaststroke</li>
                <li>Treading water with eggbeater</li>
                <li>Dolphin kick</li>
                <li>Sidestroke</li>
                <li>Butterfly</li>
                <li>First Aid</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each skill has various progressions, and will be practised for longer distances and times as the student
            improves. Elements of First Aid can be incorporated into any lesson, though I cannot officially certify you.</p>
